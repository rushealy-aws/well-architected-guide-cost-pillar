# AWS Well-Architected Review Guide for the Cost Pillar

A comprehensive step-by-step guide for performing a Well-Architected Review focused on the Cost Optimization pillar using the AWS Well-Architected Tool.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with existing workloads
- Appropriate IAM permissions for AWS Well-Architected Tool
- Basic understanding of your current AWS architecture and services

## Overview

The AWS Well-Architected Framework Cost Optimization pillar focuses on the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. This guide will walk you through using the AWS Well-Architected Tool to assess your workloads against cost optimization best practices.

Note: The Well-Architected Framework is designed to help AWS customers understand and optimize their workloads. Here are a few contexts where a Well Architected review for the Cost pillar makes sense to do:

1. Launching a new workload.
2. Periodic review of AWS spend to ensure that your spend is aligned with your business goals and available cost optimization options.
3. Before and after a change in your deployment methodology, such as a move from instance-based to containerized workload deployment or migration to a fully orchestrated, CI/CD, or infrastructure-as-code deployment model.
4. When your budget or funding changes or is expected to change.

## Cost Optimization Design Principles

Before starting your review, understand these five key design principles:

1. **Implement Cloud Financial Management** - Build capability in cost optimization through knowledge, programs, resources, and processes
2. **Adopt a consumption model** - Pay only for computing resources you require and scale based on business requirements
3. **Measure overall efficiency** - Track business output versus costs to understand gains from optimization
4. **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting** - Use AWS managed services to focus on business value
5. **Analyze and attribute expenditure** - Accurately identify usage and costs for transparent attribution

## Step 1: Access the AWS Well-Architected Tool

1. **Sign in to AWS Console**
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console
   - Go to the AWS Well-Architected Tool console at: https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/
